# Northcoders News API

## Hosted version

The API can be accessed using the following link (https://nc-news24-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Background

I built a news API for the purpose of accessing application data programatically. This mimics the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which provides this information to the front end architecture.

The database used was PSQL, and [node-postgres] (https://node-postgres.com/) was used to interact with this database.
